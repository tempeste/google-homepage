This is an attempt in reconstructing the google homepage and to test the knowledge I have on HTML and CSS as of now.
Time taken to complete the task: 13 hours
Satisfaction level: high (although there are some things I still cant get right)
Throughout the entire process, I have:
-Refreshed my understanding of the box model
-Learned how to use divs effectively
-Gained the confidence to make web designs
-Learned the meaning of favicons and how to create my own favicons
-Learned how to link favicons to the title
